## Hacks

- [Less frequent notification rings](https://github.com/arnaud33200/Signal-Android_Arnaud-Hack/commit/06e8e1e2b5855f5e566cb16a33e2bed45cfdb42f): I'm tired of hearing a ring for every single message, especially if the conversation is already open. I'm make sure it rings only one time every 1 minute
